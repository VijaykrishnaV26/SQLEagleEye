This Repo has scripts for Monitoring SQL Server - FREE.

!!!Coming Soon!!!

## What will this contain:
Plan old TSQL and Stored Procedures to Monitor and Alert for Common and critical components and processes in SQL Server.
Some of this would also be Powershell or SQLCMDExec based (Agent Job only).

## Idea:
This is going to be based out of the SQL Tiger's Performance Monitoring and further with some more customization based on my past experience and my fellow ex-team mates and friends.

To Confirm here, the Code piece here is based on Standard Best practices and implementation on SQL Server. Some would need to be tweaked and parameterized based on app / scenario.
So, know that "Everything doesn't fit a T-shirt size/format"
